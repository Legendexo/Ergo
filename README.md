An artificial neural network and API to detect Windows malware, based on [Ergo](https://github.com/evilsocket/ergo) and [LIEF](https://lief.quarkslab.com/).

## Installation

    cd /path/to/ergo-pe-av
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Use as an API

    ergo serve /path/to/ergo-pe-av --classes "clean, malware"

From the client, to scan a file that the server can access too:

    curl "http://localhost:8080/?x=/path/to/file.exe"
    # or
    curl --data "x=/path/to/file.exe" "http://localhost:8080/"

To upload the whole file:

    curl -F "x=@/path/to/file.exe" "http://localhost:8080/"

To encode a file to a vector of raw features:
    
    curl -F "x=@/path/to/file.exe" "http://localhost:8080/encode"

To scan a vector of raw features:

    curl --data "x=0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.847058823529,......" "http://localhost:8080/"

### Model Statistics

The dataset is made of ~200000 samples divided in two subfolders:

- `classes/pe-malicious` with 100000 malware samples from VirusTotal
- `classes/pe-clean` with 100000 clean samples

The `dataset.csv` training file has been generated with:

    ergo encode ergo-pe-av /media/evilsocket/4TB/datapath-pe/classes --filter "*.exe"
